Instances of large problems for the three-dimensional multiple container packing problem
==================================================================================================
These instances are used in the experiments of the paper "Hybrid genetic algorithms for the three dimensional multiple container packing problem" by Xuehao Feng, Ilkyeong Moon, and Jeongho Shin.

In the file, "L_a_b", "L" presents "large problem"; "a" presents the number of items; and "b" presents the index of instances. For example, the file "L_500_1" includes the first instance of the large problem with 500 items.
